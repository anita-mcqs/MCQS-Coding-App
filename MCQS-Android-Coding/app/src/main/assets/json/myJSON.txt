    of protein in a process called **translation**.",
    "question": "Where in the cell does this **process occur **",
    "core": "Ribosomes attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) are essential for protein-secreting cells.",
    "explanation": "The translocons are tiny docking stations on the rough ER surface that lock onto ribosomes. When a ribosome begins making proteins, the translocon opens enough for the newly created protein to feed into the pore.
    The new protein passes into the pore in a linear or helical form, because the pore is too small to allow a folded protein to pass within. The translocon pore only opens if it recognizes a special sequence of amino acids that
    ribosomes use to start a newly created protein\n<br><img src=\"file:///data/data/com.mcqs.anita.mcqs_android_coding/files/images/secretion.gif\" onclick=\"showAndroidImage(this.src)\"><br> The translocon controls whether the new
    protein will be incorporated into the plasma membrane or will be stored in soluble form within the ER. The proteins that enter the tight confines of the ER membranes get bent and folded into their characteristic final shapes. These
    shapes result in part from atomic bonds between different portions of the protein molecule. The ER performs quality control by transporting abnormal or misshaped proteins back into the cell body where they are recycled. Stored proteins travel
     into another cell organelle, called the Golgi apparatus, and eventually exit the cell. When the ribosome finishes synthesizing a protein, the translocon ejects the ribosome and plugs up the pore\n\nAll proteins, whether they are used in a cell
     or secreted, are synthesized at cellular structures called ribosomes. If the protein is to be used with the cell, the ribosome remains in the cytosol and the completed protein is released into the cytosol. But if a protein is destined for secretion,
      the very first amino acids in the polypeptide chain are a special sequence called the signal sequence. Shortly after the synthesis of this sequence is completed, the synthesis stops until the ribosome docks at the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nOnce
      docked, the synthesis continues, with the new protein threading into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The signal sequence is then cleaved from the polypeptide chain. Often, too, further enzymes cut the protein in other places. Most secreted proteins are
      modified before secretion.\n\nNext, vesicles containing the protein bud from the rough endoplasmic reticulum and move too nearby the nearby Golgi apparatus. This is comprised of a stack of large, flattened vesicles. It is often likened to a stack of
       pita breads. The vesicles from the rough endoplasmic reticulum fuse with one end, adding their proteins to the first flattened vesicle. In turn, small vesicles bud from this structure and transfer the protein to the next layer of the stack.
       This continues until the protein winds up at the opposite end of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nOnce the protein has moved through the entire Golgi apparatus, secretion vesicles containing the protein bud off. These vesicles move to the plasma membrane,
       attach to the membrane, and then release their contents into the extracellular fluid through the process of exocytosis. Often a signal is required to initiate the release.",

The roots from C5 and C6 pierce through the scalenus medius, while the C7 root passes in front of the muscle.\n\nThe nerve descends behind (posterior to) the brachial plexus and the axillary artery and vein, resting on the outer surface of the serratus anterior. It extends along the side of the thorax to the lower border of that muscle, supplying filaments to each of its digitations (finger-like projections).",

    "background": "When a protein is being synthesized by the ribosome it is typically docked onto  **translocons** . \n\nThe ribosome and its associated enzymes then transfer an amino acid from the transfer RNA to an elongating length of protein in a process called **translation**.",
    "question": "Where in the cell does this **process occur **",
    "core": "Ribosomes attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) are essential for protein-secreting cells.",
    "explanation": "The translocons are tiny docking stations on the rough ER surface that lock onto ribosomes. When a ribosome begins making proteins, the translocon opens enough for the newly created protein to feed into the pore. The new protein passes
    into the pore in a linear or helical form, because the pore is too small to allow a folded protein to pass within. The translocon pore only opens if it recognizes a special sequence of amino acids that ribosomes use to start a newly created
    protein\n <br><img src=\"file:///data/data/com.mcqs.anita.mcqs_android_coding/files/images/secretion.gif\" onclick=\"showAndroidImage(this.src)\"> <br>The translocon controls whether the new protein will be incorporated into the plasma membrane or will be stored in soluble form within the ER. The proteins that enter the tight confines of the ER membranes get bent and folded into their characteristic final shapes. These shapes result in part from atomic bonds between different portions of the protein molecule. The ER performs quality control by transporting abnormal or misshaped proteins back into the cell body where they are recycled. Stored proteins travel into another cell organelle, called the Golgi apparatus, and eventually exit the cell. When the ribosome finishes synthesizing a protein, the translocon ejects the ribosome and plugs up the pore\n\nAll proteins, whether they are used in a cell or secreted, are synthesized at cellular structures called ribosomes. If the protein is to be used with the cell, the ribosome remains in the cytosol and the completed protein is released into the cytosol. But if a protein is destined for secretion, the very first amino acids in the polypeptide chain are a special sequence called the signal sequence. Shortly after the synthesis of this sequence is completed, the synthesis stops until the ribosome docks at the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nOnce docked, the synthesis continues, with the new protein threading into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The signal sequence is then cleaved from the polypeptide chain. Often, too, further enzymes cut the protein in other places. Most secreted proteins are modified before secretion.\n\nNext, vesicles containing the protein bud from the rough endoplasmic reticulum and move too nearby the nearby Golgi apparatus. This is comprised of a stack of large, flattened vesicles. It is often likened to a stack of pita breads. The vesicles from the rough endoplasmic reticulum fuse with one end, adding their proteins to the first flattened vesicle. In turn, small vesicles bud from this structure and transfer the protein to the next layer of the stack. This continues until the protein winds up at the opposite end of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nOnce the protein has moved through the entire Golgi apparatus, secretion vesicles containing the protein bud off. These vesicles move to the plasma membrane, attach to the membrane, and then release their contents into the extracellular fluid through the process of exocytosis. Often a signal is required to initiate the release.",

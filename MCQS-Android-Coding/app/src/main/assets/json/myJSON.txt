    "background": "When a protein is being synthesized by the ribosome it is typically docked onto  **translocons**. \n\nThe ribosome and its associated enzymes then transfer an amino acid from the transfer RNA to an elongating length of protein in a process called **translation** as shown below :\n\n<img src=@link>",
    "question": "---\n\n###Where **in the cell** does this process occur ?",
    "core": "Ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum are ` membrane bound`  and are responsible for the assembly of proteins in a  process that  is called translation.",
    "explanation": "Certain cells of the pancreas and digestive tract produce a high volume of protein as enzymes. Many of the proteins are produced in quantity in the cells of the pancreas and the digestive tract and function as digestive enzymes.\n\nThe rough ER working with membrane bound ribosomes takes polypeptides and amino acids from the cytosol and continues protein assembly including, at an early stage, recognising a ‘destination label’ attached to each of them\n\n> The translocons are tiny docking stations on the rough ER surface that lock onto ribosomes. \n\nWhen a ribosome begins making proteins, the translocon opens enough for the newly created protein to feed into the pore. The new protein passes into the pore in a linear or helical form, because the pore is too small to allow a folded protein to pass within. The translocon pore only opens if it recognizes a special sequence of amino acids that ribosomes use to start a newly created protein\n\n<img src=@lin>\n\nThe translocon controls whether the new protein will be incorporated into the plasma membrane or will be stored in soluble form within the ER. The proteins that enter the tight confines of the ER membranes get bent and folded into their characteristic final shapes. These shapes result in part from atomic bonds between different portions of the protein molecule. The ER performs quality control by transporting abnormal or misshaped proteins back into the cell body where they are recycled. Stored proteins travel into another cell organelle, called the Golgi apparatus, and eventually exit the cell. When the ribosome finishes synthesizing a protein, the translocon ejects the ribosome and plugs up the pore\n\nAll proteins, whether they are used in a cell or secreted, are synthesized at cellular structures called ribosomes. If the protein is to be used with the cell, the ribosome remains in the cytosol and the completed protein is released into the cytosol. But if a protein is destined for secretion, the very first amino acids in the polypeptide chain are a special sequence called the signal sequence. Shortly after the synthesis of this sequence is completed, the synthesis stops until the ribosome docks at the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nOnce docked, the synthesis continues, with the new protein threading into the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The signal sequence is then cleaved from the polypeptide chain. Often, too, further enzymes cut the protein in other places. Most secreted proteins are modified before secretion.\n\nNext, vesicles containing the protein bud from the rough endoplasmic reticulum and move too nearby the nearby Golgi apparatus. This is comprised of a stack of large, flattened vesicles. It is often likened to a stack of pita breads. The vesicles from the rough endoplasmic reticulum fuse with one end, adding their proteins to the first flattened vesicle. In turn, small vesicles bud from this structure and transfer the protein to the next layer of the stack. This continues until the protein winds up at the opposite end of the Golgi apparatus.\n\nOnce the protein has moved through the entire Golgi apparatus, secretion vesicles containing the protein bud off. These vesicles move to the plasma membrane, attach to the membrane, and then release their contents into the extracellular fluid through the process of exocytosis. Often a signal is required to initiate the release.",

All of them function as G protein-coupled receptors, meaning that they exert their effects via a complex second messenger system. Dopamine receptors can be divided into two families, known as D1-like and D2-like. <p>The ultimate effect of D1-like receptors can be excitation (via opening of sodium channels) or inhibition (via opening of potassium channels); the ultimate effect of D2-like receptors is usually inhibition of the target neuron. Consequently, it is incorrect to describe dopamine itself as either excitatory or inhibitory. <p>He goes on to explain that there is a secondary mechanism mode of action of dopamine receptors that works through an",

    "explanation": "Dopamine receptors can act through G protein-independent mechanisms via interactions with ion channels.\n\nIon channels are pore-forming membrane proteins whose functions include establishing a resting membrane potential, shaping action potentials and other electrical signals by gating the flow of ions across the cell membrane, controlling the flow of ions across secretory and epithelial cells, and regulating cell volume. <p>Ion channels are present in the membranes of all cells.",

    "question": "<br>What receptors fit in the D2 family of receptors?",
    "core": "Dopamine receptors can be divided into two families, known as the D1 Like (D1 and D5) family and the D2 Like (D2, D3 and D4) family.",
    "explanation": "The D1-like family is made up of the D1 and D5 receptor subtypes. Activation of D1-like family receptors is coupled to the G protein Gsα, which subsequently activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing the intracellular concentration of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). D1 is encoded by the dopamine receptor D1 gene (DRD1). D5 is encoded by the dopamine receptor D5 gene (DRD5). <p>The D2-like family is made up of the D2, D3 and D4 receptor subtype. Activation of D2-like family receptors is coupled to the G protein Giα, which directly inhibits the formation of cAMP by inhibiting the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. D2 is encoded by the dopamine receptor D2 gene (DRD2), of which there are two forms: D2Sh (short) and D2Lh (long). <p>The D2Sh form is pre-synaptically situated, having modulatory functions (namely autoreceptors, which regulate neurotransmission by feed-back mechanisms, affecting synthesis, storage, and release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft).<p> D3 is encoded by the dopamine receptor D3 gene (DRD3). Maximum expression of dopamine D3 receptors is noted in the islands of Calleja and nucleus accumbens.<p> D4 is encoded by the dopamine receptor D4 gene (DRD4). The D4 receptor gene displays polymorphisms that differ in a variable number tandem repeat present within the coding sequence of exon 3. <p>Dopamine receptors control neural signalling that modulates many important behaviours, such as spatial working memory. Although dopamine receptors are widely distributed in the brain, different areas have different receptor types densities, reflecting different functional roles.",
